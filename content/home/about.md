# Namaste!

I am presently prepping up for starting my PhD in Electrical Enginnering department at Arizona State University. Here, I will be working with [Prof. Angelia Nedich](http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~angelia/nedich.html) and [Prof. Anna Scaglione](https://scaglione.engineering.asu.edu/) on Large Scale Optimization. 

Previously, I was holding the position of Systems Engineer at [Netradyne](http://www.netradyne.com/). I was working on using sensor information from Mobile devices/IMU chips to draw out statistics on the general driving behavior of an individual to develop better driver safety features.

I have masters from Electrical Department at IIT Madras. I did my Senior thesis under the guidance of [Dr. Radha Krishna Ganti](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~rganti/) on the broad topic Rank Preserving optimization using Factored Gradient Descent. My thesis work can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9dixvvp44q79hc/thesis.pdf?dl=0)
